This is the directory for the portfolio. It uses the CV and Resume from subdirectories, but the README and ToDo.txt files are kept separate from those of the website. 

This template was found online and then hacked heavily to create the level of simplicity that was desired. As such, there are a lot of features that are missing that are listed in ToDo.txt (non-exhaustive). 

To get this website online, use 'git push' and it will add the files to the github repository where the website is hosted.
