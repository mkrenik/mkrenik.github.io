Top Priorities:
Text on Speech processing page
Decide what else to put on hair cutting page (either add more or make it more obvious disclosure has been withheld)
Give more info on what I was specifically responsible for (all pages). 
Add awards and publications and grades (if top marks) for each project on each project page. 

Medium Priority:
Consider adding ABB project (do I have decent pictures?). 
Consider adding "Recurse Center" projects 
Consider adding the RSE fish zapper (after significant contribution)
Consider adding the PyBot (after significant contribution)

Other: 

Make a template HTML file so that changes to the header don't have to be made in every individual file. 

Add in music section (need to have some good music that I record)

Add in library section with books that I have read (since a given date) with summary and review

Think about adding a footer with some contact and copyright details 

Redo the HTML so that the header text doesn't move around when you switch pages ( has to do with the size of the fonts apparently)

Delete unnecessary scripts and css (and maybe loader.gif)

Add in HTML and CSS so it can adapt to different sized devices

Redo the HTML so that when you zoom in on one web page, it keeps that zoom as you navigate teh entire site (instead of different pages having different levels of zoom).
