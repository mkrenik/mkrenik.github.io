<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Automated Sleep Support Design and Analysis</strong> - Spring 2016<br />
Designed and constructed a fully functional bed with embedded sensors and actuators that can adapt to a user's weight distribution throughout the night. Modeled the bed and human body system in Simulink and analyzed optimal control techniques. This project was done as a Master's thesis with the Sensory Motor Systems lab at ETH Zurich and received top marks.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Feedback mechanisms for real-walking VR system</strong> - Fall 2015<br />
Developed multiple feedback mechanisms (visual, haptic, auditory) to inform users when they collided with virtual walls while using a HMD (Oculus Rift) in a real walking environment (InterSense 6DOF tracking system). Designed a haptic feedback attachment to the HMD with linear resonant and eccentric rotating mass actuators. Ran a user study to determine which feedback mechanisms were intuitive and instructive to users to avoid future collisions. This project was done as a Semester Project with the Innovation Center for Virtual Reality at ETH Zurich.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Buskr: An app for tipping street musicians</strong> - Fall 2015<br />
Made an Android app that uses proximity to an iBeacon sensor and the Klarna API to allow you to easily tip street musicians without needing cash. Also used the MixRadio API to help you find local musicians if there are no nearby street musicians. Winner of the MixRadio API prize. Project completed at HackJunction in Helsinki, Finland.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Stitch: A powerpoint merging tool</strong> - Fall 2015<br />
Created a web app that allows people to upload individual power point files and stitch them together into one seamless presentation. Winner of the Dropbox API prize. Project completed at HackZurich in Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Road event prediction algorithm using local car data</strong> - Spring 2015<br />
Created a machine learning algorithm and web app demo for predicting when events on the road are taking place based upon velocity and acceleration data from nearby cars. Project completed at the Volkswagen Codfest 8 Hackathon in Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>3D Reconstruction using Motion Vectors</strong> - Spring 2015<br />
Attempted to use motion vectors used for encoding / compressing videos to create point correspondences between frames and reconstruct a 3D scene. Algorithm was based on Structure from Motion. Project completed in the 3D Photography course at ETH Zurich.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Gesture Recognition for Media Player control</strong> - Spring 2015<br />
Using the LeapMotion without built-in gesture recognition, created a support vector machine to distinguish static gestures and control a media player. Project completed in the User Interface Engineering course at ETH Zurich.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Machine Learning Course Projects</strong> - Fall 2014<br />
Completed three different projects with the highest overall performance as part of a competition in the Machine Learning course at ETH Zurich. Project 1 (MATLAB) uses linear regression to predict microprocessor performance based upon given technical specifications. Project 2 (MATLAB) uses support vector machines to classify medical images as diseased and normal. Project 3 (python) is a multi-class classification problem that determines city and country codes based upon text recognition.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Computer Vision Course Projects</strong> - Fall 2014<br />
Implemented three different computer vision algorithms using C++: the Cannny Edge Detector, Hough transform, and Stereoscopic Vision</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Real-time Speech Processing Pipeline on Smartphone</strong> - Spring 2014<br />
Programmed a speech processing pipeline in C on an Android phone that classifies the background noise in an environment and suppresses the noise component. Project completed as part of the Applications in Digital Signal Processing course at UT Dallas.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Mouse control for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome patients</strong> - Fall 2013<br />
Embedded an inertial measurement unit into a brace for Carpal Tunnel System patients and used the data to control mouse funcionality on a desktop computer. Project completed as part of the Senior Design Project course at UT Dallas.</p>
