					<p> 
Home care robots enable users to do more by automating basic home care tasks, such as vacuuming and mopping. I've been working at iRobot as a software engineer since February 2017 on the Robot Applications team. I develop code for path planning, sensor calibration, state machines, robot user interface, and production line testing. I am responsible for developing new features, debugging robot behaviors, and testing the firmware on all of our home care robots that are currently under development. 
<br /><br />
I work closely with the UI/UX team to implement new motions, behaviors, and interfaces on the robots that make sense to our users. While it is critical that our robots to clean effectively, it is also important for the robot's movements to make sense to a user. If a user understands the robots actions, the user will trust the robot to operate without interfering or without even being present. For example, the path of our vacuum cleaning robots can be seen in the carpet due to the way the carpet has been brushed. My team and I have worked on code so that the robots follow organized, parallel ranks, so it is obvious to a homeowner that the robot has cleaned the entire room. 
<br /><br />
I also work with electrical, mechanical, and systems engineers to make sure the firmware that our team is up to date with recent hardware changes. Because this is a consumer product, the cost of goods sold is especially important, and hardware engineers are always modifying various sensors and other components on the robot to either work better or to cost less. As a software engineer, it is important to understand these systems to understand if bugs are due to the hardware or the software. It is also necessary to rewrite firmware to support the new hardware before bugs are created to prevent slowing down the product development pipeline. 
<br /><br />
My work has also brought me to our production facilities in China to support software versioning, sensor calibration, and production line testing. This gave me insight into manufacturing at our company and was a very interesting cross-cultural experience.
